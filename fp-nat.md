# Configure Source NAT for Outbound Traffic
{: #configure-source-nat-for-outbound-traffic}

Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

You may utilize your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} appliance to perform NAT on outbound traffic from your client machines. To do so:

1. Go to System > Network > Routes, and navigate to the **RNAT** tab. Click **Configure RNAT**.

2. Specify the source subnet (and mask) to which you wish to apply RNAT and click **OK**.

The Internet-bound traffic sourced from any IP in this subnet will now use NAT for tradfic on the Citrix NetScalerâ€™s public IP address.
