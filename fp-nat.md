# Configure Source NAT for Outbound Traffic
Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

You may utilize your Citrix NetScaler VPX appliance to perform NAT on outbound traffic from your client machines. To do so:

1. Go to System > Network > Routes, and navigate to the **RNAT** tab. Click **Configure RNAT**. 

2. Specify the source subnet (and mask) to which you wish to apply RNAT and click **OK**. 

The Internet-bound traffic sourced from any IP in this subnet will now use NAT for tradfic on the Citrix NetScalerâ€™s public IP address.
