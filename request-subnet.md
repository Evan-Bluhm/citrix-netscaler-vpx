# Request a Private Subnet
{: #request-a-private-subnet}

In most deployments, the Citrix NetScaler VPX appliance is deployed in a reverse-proxy configuration. However, to configure the VPX with a forward-proxy configuration, Virtual IPs (VIPs) are needed, since the configuration will exist on a private network instead of a public one.

You must open a ticket with the IBMÂ© Cloud support team and request that a private network for your Citrix NetScaler VPX appliance be added to your account. Note that you will require at least two private addresses, so you should request a private subnet size of at least /29.
