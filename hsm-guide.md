# Deploying and Configuring the IBM Hardware Security Module (HSM) with Citrix Netscaler VPX
This Step by Step guides you through integrating the HSM with Citrix Netscaler VPX. The two services will then be able to communicate and generate the cryptographic material required to create a certificate.

## About the deployment
This deployment was built and tested with the following component specifications:

| NetScaler VPX Version & Build	| HSM Software Version | HSM Firmware version | HSM Client Version |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| NS12.1: Build 48.13.nc | 6.2.2-5 | 6.10.9 | 6.2.2 |

**NOTE:** If you have an older version of VPX or, if when ordering the device through the IBMÂ© Cloud platform only see versions 11.1 and earlier as selection options, the device can be upgraded so that the set-up described in this guide can be completed. 

## Logical topology
The below diagram shows the network traffic flow for the SSL offload use case. This provides a visual and logical perspective of the trust link and the configuration between VPX and the HSM appliance.

If you are not familiar with SSL offload, review this [Citrix article](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12-1/ssl.html).

## What you'll accomplish

In this Step-by-Step guide you will learn how to deploy and configure an HSM with a Citrix Netscaler VPX:

Task  | Description
------------- | -------------
[Order a Hardware Security Module (HSM)](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-order-the-ibm-hardware-security-module-hsm-) | First, you'll need to order an HSM.
[Order a Citrix Netscaler VPX](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-order-a-citrix-netscaler-vpx) | If you haven't already, you'll order a Citrix Netscaler VPX.
[Initialize the HSM](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-initialize-ibm-hardware-security-module-hsm-) | Most configurations require initialization of the HSM device. Without this, only certain `show` commands can be executed. 
[Create a partition](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-create-a-partition) | A partition is a logical and independent space that is associated or attached to the client requesting or creating cryptographic objects in the HSM engine.
[Install the HSM client software](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-install-the-ibm-hardware-security-module-hsm-client-software) | In this sub-section, VPX will be installed with the software and utilities required to interact with the HSM. |
[Establish the Network Trust Link (NTL)](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-establish-a-network-trust-link-ntl-) | A Network Trust Link (NTL) is a secure channel for the Hardware Security Module (HSM) and the client to communicate. |
[Create keys and generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-create-keys-and-generate-the-certificate-signing-request-csr-) | In this sub-section we will create a key pair that will be used to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and order / request a certificate with it. | 
[Order the certificate](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-order-an-ssl-certificate) | Order an SSL certificate for your Citrix Netscaler VPX.
[Retrieve and transfer the certificate](/docs/infrastructure/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-retrieve-and-transfer-the-certificate) | Retrieve the SSL certificate ordered earlier and leave everything ready for its installation and configuration in the next Step by Step.
