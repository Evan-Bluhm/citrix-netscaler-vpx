7. Click **Close** then click **Done**.

	Assuming the two IBM Cloud DNS resolvers can be reached from your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} appliance, the service group will show as green.

8. Now, go to **Traffic Management > Load Balancing > Virtual Servers** and click **Add** to define your DNS Virtual server.
9. Under Basic Settings give a name to your virtual server, choose the DNS protocol and port `53`, then assign an IP address from your private subnet.
