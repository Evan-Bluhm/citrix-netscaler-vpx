## Application Security

To secure application traffic, customers can take advantage of security features such as Application Content Filtering, Priority Queuing, and a Web Application Firewall.

## Traffic Filtering
{: #traffic-filtering}

The Citrix Netscaler VPX filters requests from end-users to the servers and responses from the servers to end-users. A Learning feature with the Application Firewall allows the profiling of sessions in real time and the determination of whether to allow traffic.

## PCI-DSS Reporting
{: #pci-dss-reporting}

Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) consists of twelve criteria that must be met by businesses that process online credit card payments. The PCI-DSS reports consist of a list of those criteria that are relevant to your Application Firewall configuration. The report also lists whether your current configuration meets each criterion, and suggests how to configure the application firewall to meet those standards.

## Global Load Balancing (GSLB)
